# Understanding Things

## Where the concept lie?

- If a fisherman can catch more fishes with more fishing rods as fishing is just waiting for a nibble(bite) provided that they have the capability and equipment to make use of it

## Parallelism

- several complete CPUs that are sort of tied together and share something like memory or an I/O bus
- It implies that there is multiple copies of the hardware

## Concurrency

- it can be much more abstract concept where we have the illusion that thing happen simultaneously but what the computer actually does is it spends some little time running one program, some little time on another and so on.
